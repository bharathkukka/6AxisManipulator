# Cycloidal Drive Design for 6-Axis Manipulator

---

## Overview
Cycloidal drives are highly efficient speed reducers capable of producing large torque, making them ideal for heavy-duty robotic applications. In my 6-axis manipulator, the cycloidal drive is used to achieve significant speed reduction and torque amplification, enabling precise and powerful arm movements.

## Key Features & Applications
- **High torque output**
- **Compact and robust design**
- **Low backlash and high precision**
- **Used in:** Robotics, automation, heavy machinery

---

## Core Mechanism
- **Eccentric Nut:** Mounted on the motor shaft, positions the cycloidal disc off-center.
- **Cycloidal Disc:** Shifts in and out, meshing with cylindrical pins arranged around it.
- **Torque Transfer:** Wobbling disc pushes load pins, which transfer torque to the load plate.
- **Thrust Bearing:** Allows the load plate to rotate freely while being constrained vertically.

## Design Stages
1. **Casing**
   - Holds 3mm pins in 49 bores for compactness and effective meshing.
   - Attaches to motor and external structures via internal and external threaded bores.
   - Cover screws into casing for a compact assembly.
2. **Cycloidal Disc**
   - Special cycloidal profile for unique motion.
   - Five large bores for load pins, central bearing for free rotation.
   - Mounted on motor shaft with eccentric nut and bearing.
3. **Load Pins & Load Plate**
   - Load pins sized for minimal backlash, secured with countersunk screws.
   - Load plate with 10 threaded bores for pins and external connections.
   - Flange and thrust bearing restrict vertical motion; bearing and nylon spacer restrict axial motion.
4. **Cover**
   - Screws into casing, secures thrust bearing and internal components.
   - Slots for tool anchoring and environmental protection.

## How It Works
- Motor rotation causes eccentric nut to move cycloidal disc in a wobbling motion.
- Disc meshes with pins, slowly rotates, and transfers amplified torque to load plate via load pins.
- Thrust bearing ensures smooth, constrained rotation of the load plate.

## Assembly & Performance Tips
- Ensure precise positioning of pins and load plate to minimize backlash.
- Use thrust bearings and spacers for smooth operation and durability.
- Compact design allows integration into robotic arms and other machinery.

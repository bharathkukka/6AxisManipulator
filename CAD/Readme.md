# Gearbox Overview

In my 6-axis manipulator project, I utilized three advanced gearbox types—Planetary Gearbox, Cycloidal Gearbox, and Harmonic Drive—to achieve precise motion control, high torque, and compact design. Each gearbox was selected for its unique advantages in robotics and automation, contributing to the overall performance and reliability of the manipulator.

## 1. Planetary Gearbox
Planetary gearboxes consist of a central sun gear, planet gears that rotate around the sun, and an outer ring gear. This arrangement offers high torque density, compact size, and excellent efficiency. Planetary gearboxes are widely used in precision motion applications due to their ability to distribute load across multiple gears.

## 2. Cycloidal Gearbox
Cycloidal gearboxes use a cycloidal disc and rolling pins to achieve motion transmission. They are known for their high shock-load resistance, compactness, and ability to provide high reduction ratios in a single stage. Cycloidal drives are commonly found in robotics and industrial automation for their durability and precision.

## 3. Harmonic Drive
Harmonic drives utilize a flexible spline, circular spline, and wave generator to achieve motion. This design enables zero backlash, high torque, and compact form factor. Harmonic drives are ideal for applications requiring precise positioning, such as robotic arms and aerospace mechanisms.

# 6-Axis Manipulator Robot Visualization

I built this MATLAB mini-toolkit to visualize and experiment with a 6-DOF serial manipulator. Three scripts drive everything: one GUI for interactive FK/IK, one sandbox for teaching & quick experiments, and one workspace sampler to map reachable points. Below I explain each script (no aggregate summary) and after each explanation I include a placeholder line to drop an image or GIF.

## `SAM_Robot.m` 
[Code Here](SAM_Robot.m) 


This is my scratch / teaching script (no GUI) to poke at the robot quickly.

What it does:

- Defines the same DH chain and creates `SerialLink`.
- Plots the zero pose and opens the interactive `teach()` panel (joint sliders).
- Sets up a sample target pose: `transl(0.02,0.03,0.3)*trotz(pi/4)` for IK experimentation (IK call is currently commented out).
- Provides two joint vectors (`q1`, `q2`) hinting at a possible trajectory via `jtraj` (also commented for now).

Use case: fast manual experimentation without GUI overhead; great for adjusting link parameters and testing teach mode.

## `Workspace.m`

[Code Here](Workspace.m)

This script brute-force samples the workspace by random joint angles and does manual DH forward kinematics (no toolbox dependence for FK math).

What it does (concise):

- Generates random joint sets uniformly in [-pi, pi].
- Multiplies manual DH A-matrices to compute FK (toolbox-agnostic).
- Extracts XYZ and plots a 3D scatter of reachable points.
- Uses equal-axis 3D view for a clean workspace cloud.

Why manual FK? It’s toolbox-agnostic: no Robotics Toolbox required for FK here, which helps verify the DH chain independently.

## `GUISix.m`

[Code Here](GUISix.m)

This is my interactive GUIDE-based GUI for forward and inverse kinematics testing.

What it does (concise):

- FK from joint angles (degrees) to pose + XYZ display.
- Position-only IK from XYZ with mask `[1 1 1 0 0 0]`.
- Standard DH with six links in a `SerialLink` robot.
- Error dialog on IK failure; optional integer-style readout.

Key toolbox calls: `fkine`, `plot`, `ikine`, plus user interface callbacks generated by GUIDE.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (tested around 2025 releases) with Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox for GUI and sandbox scripts.
- Only `Workspace.m` can run without the toolbox (manual FK math).
- Basic DH parameter familiarity helps when tweaking link lengths (`a1,a2,a3,d1..d4`).

## How I Run Things

```text
Run GUISix      -> interactive FK/IK (buttons BFK / BIK)
Run SAM_Robot   -> open teach panel & experiment
Run Workspace   -> regenerate workspace point cloud
```

## Folder Layout

```text
Robot-Visualization/
  GUISix.m        GUI logic
  GUISix.fig      GUIDE layout
  SAM_Robot.m     Sandbox / teach demo
  Workspace.m     Workspace sampling cloud
  RobotJointVis/  Images & media (add your PNG/GIFs)
  README.md       This file
```

---

## Customizing

- Change geometry: edit `a1,a2,a3,d1..d4` consistently in all scripts.
- Increase workspace density: raise `num_samples` in `Workspace.m`.
- Full pose IK: adjust transform in GUI and use mask `[1 1 1 1 1 1]` (may need orientation seed).
- Trajectories: uncomment `jtraj(q1,q2,steps)` in `SAM_Robot.m` and then `plot(qtraj)`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| IK dialog error | Target XYZ unreachable | Try nearer point / adjust link lengths |
| Angles appear truncated | I intentionally floor values | Remove `floor()` calls in GUI callbacks |
| Toolbox functions undefined | Robotics Toolbox not installed / on path | Install & add to MATLAB path |
| Odd workspace shape | Parameters differ between scripts | Sync all `a` and `d` values |

---

## Future Enhancements

- Orientation-aware IK in GUI.
- Animated joint trajectory playback inside GUI.
- Collision / obstacle visualization.
- Export point cloud (PLY / CSV) for external analysis.
- Simple path planner between two poses.
